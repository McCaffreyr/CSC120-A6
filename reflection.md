Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
I can definitely see how it'd be helpful. I'm not sure I'd want to use them for every assignment right now, but I think I might use them on complex assignments or if I'm getting an error I don't understand.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Originally I was using the train instance I made in the @Before section, which got confusing for me. It was much easier when I made a new instance in each unit test, so I'd recommend trying that to new students. I also went to office hours which was very helpful.
